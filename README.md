# Work on your ADHD
The idea: You sit in an office and are supposed to do very mundane, boring work (Here I'll eventually throw in my "lists" suggestion hehe).
However, there is a ton of stuff distracting you - which you have to do - Because there's only a maximum time you can do your work before having to fill up your :sparkles: happiness :sparkles:. There even fits a "Time is running out" in here!
Spoiler: Yes, the distractions give you happiness.

# The tools used

I used QB64 for the game mechanics and aesprite to create the sprites.

# The gamejam

Check out the monthly mini game jam here: http://berlinminijam.de/
This was my third time participating in any game jam, and also this particular one and worked alone, not like in <a href=https://mariocake.itch.io/laser-bees-shooting-space-frogs>my first jam participation</a> or <a href=https://loudar.itch.io/vacuuflower>my second jam participation</a>.
