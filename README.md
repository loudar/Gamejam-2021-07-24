The idea: You sit in an office and are supposed to do very mundane, boring work (Here I'll eventually throw in my "lists" suggestion hehe).
However, there is a ton of stuff distracting you - which you have to do - Because there's only a maximum time you can do your work before having to fill up your :sparkles: happiness :sparkles:. There even fits a "Time is running out" in here!
Spoiler: Yes, the distractions give you happiness.
